Hosting VDI or Remote Desktop Services on-premises is a complex task with several components which needed to be deployed and managed.
see [reference architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/desktop-hosting-logical-architecture)

## Possible Scenarios
* Enabling remote working in short time-frames, tactical response. (Covid!).
* Legacy LOB application that have no native way to share across platforms and devices.
* Resource optimization e.g applications that are resource intensive.
* VPN replacement. 

## End user computing needs are evolving
* Keeping data and resources safe while enabling appropriate level access for users.
* Ensuring compliance and local regulations across industries like financial services, health care, government etc.
* Access to IT services on demand for an increasingly elastic workforce (mergers/acquisitions, short-term employees, contractors, partners).
* Meeting employee-specific needs (BYOD or mobile staff, call centers, branch workers).
* Supporting specialized workloads (design/engineering, legacy apps, software development and testing).

## Microsoft cloud solutions such as AVD powered by Azure can help provide a secure way delivering desktops and apps virtually anywhere. 
* Comes with built-in security and the scale/agility of Azure.

## Other Enablers for Remote Workers
* [Remote Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/termserv/remote-desktop-protocol)
* [AAD Application Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy)
* [App Service with AAD Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization)
* [Mobile Device Management (MDM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/)
* [Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)
* [Windows 10 VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/vpn/vpn-guide)
* Partner products such as Citrix, VMWare

## What can you do with AVD
* Set up a multi-session Windows 10 deployment that delivers a full Windows 10 with scalability.
* Virtualize Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise and optimize it to run in multi-user virtual scenarios.
* Provide Windows 7 virtual desktops with free Extended Security Updates.
* Bring your existing Remote Desktop Services (RDS) and Windows Server desktops and apps to any computer.
* Virtualize both desktops and apps.
* Manage Windows 10, Windows Server, and Windows 7 desktops and apps with a unified management experience.

## Solution Overview
* Remote users can use variaty of platforms, devices and clients to connect. Windows AVD Client is most popular way.
